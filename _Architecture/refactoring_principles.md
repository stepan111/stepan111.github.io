title:  "[ WIP ] Refactoring for declarative languages"
categories: Architecture
---


Here are some clean code principles that can be used for declarative languages:

* Naming convention([terraform](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint/blob/v0.16.2/docs/rules/terraform_naming_convention.md))
* DRY - no duplication
* KISS - minimize dependecies
* YAGNI - Minimizes the number of entities
* SOLID - choose abstractions and interfaces properly
* Automate  your linter usage
