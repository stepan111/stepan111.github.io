1. Naming convention . Use searchable names for each resource/data/variable/etc.
2. Define variables and locals in separate file
3. Don't use same name for different resources.
4. Use comments properly. Try to describe what you comment in resource/var name first.
5. Don't use conditions within resource. Define a separate local instead.
